					</h2>
					<p>A young girl with a disability who was defiled two years ago is yet to receive justice, despite
						OCS Makimeny forwarding her file to ODPP Bomet. Voices for Justice has visited the family twice
						and, together with partners, submitted a petition to ODPP demanding action.
						Today, she received a wheelchair donated by AIC Litein Hospital. We appreciate this timely
						support and thank Stella Seurey for her dedicated efforts in securing the assistive device.
						The girl comes from a very humble background and wishes to return to school, but she lacks
						school fees and even basic items like sanitary towels. Attempts to secure CDF support from Area
						MP Hon. Victor Kipngetich Koech Mandazi have not succeeded.
						We appeal to well-wishers and leaders—including Governor Prof. Hillary Barchok, Hon. Linet
						Chepkorir (Toto), Wakili Hillary K. Sigei, Hon. Richard Kilel andnHon. Hon Bavina Serem to
						support her education and dignity.
						Your support can restore her hope and push for justice.

					<p>A Child Sex Abuser Evaded Justice in Kenya Until our Chairperson at Anti- GBV desk Margaret Ruto
						Took Matters Into Her Own Hands
						Some coincidences are impossible to ignore.
						When Margaret Ruto, a Kenyan living in American travelled back to Kenya in 2018, she expected a
						peaceful homecoming. Instead, a disturbing twist of fate awaited her: a man who lived just 10
						minutes from her home in the United States had opened an orphanage less than 10 minutes from her
						ancestral village in Kenya — and children were alleging sexual abuse inside it.
						The village was in uproar. Two girls, aged 12 and 14, had recently escaped from the Dow Family
						Children’s Home and described horrifying sexual abuse by the orphanage’s director, Gregory Dow.
						Ruto was taken behind the orphanage to a rough mound of soil. Former employees said a
						9-month-old boy, James Kipkirui, was buried there after choking while left unsupervised.
						Standing over the tiny grave, Ruto felt her life split in two: before this moment, and after it.
						The “ordinary woman” suddenly felt called to become an investigator.
						But Dow had already fled back to Pennsylvania after villagers confronted him and alerted police.
						Authorities said they missed him at the airport by just a few hours. Locals feared the foreign
						missionary — entitled, wealthy, and claiming to be deeply Christian — would escape justice
						entirely.
						> “I was meant to know about this,” Ruto remembers thinking. “And I was meant to do something
						about it.”
						A Relentless Quest for Justice
						What followed was a year Ruto could never have imagined:
						investigating across two continents, interviewing traumatized children, watching her back
						constantly, and compiling evidence that powerful people preferred to ignore. She cried alone in
						her car more times than she could count.
						Her evidence eventually reached the FBI, triggered a full investigation, appeared on the front
						pages of Kenyan newspapers, and helped spark major reforms in Kenya’s regulation of children’s
						homes.
						Until now, the only public reference to her role had been a vague FBI note that it was “acting
						on a tip.”
						Dow Is Finally Sentenced
						After agreeing to a plea deal, Gregory Dow, now 61, was sentenced in a U.S. federal court to 188
						months (15 years, 8 months) for engaging in illicit sexual conduct in foreign places. He will be
						nearly 80 years old when his sentence ends.
						During sentencing, he apologized “for the pain that I’ve caused.”
						Judge Edward G. Smith called him “a missionary from hell.”
						Former U.S. attorney William McSwain credited Ruto directly:
						> “Ms. Ruto’s information reached dedicated FBI agents who gathered the evidence needed to hold
						Dow accountable. This case is a textbook example of how the public can help bring predators to
						justice.”
						Meanwhile, Kenyan authorities exhumed baby James’s body as part of a separate investigation into
						his death.
						Ruto says she made herself one promise when she first saw that grave: nothing not corrupt
						officials in Kenya nor slow U.S. bureaucracy — would stop her from fighting for those children.
						> “I’m just an ordinary woman, a nurse, a mother,” she said. “I had no idea what I was getting
						into.”
						A System That Failed Vulnerable Children
						Kenya hosts many missionary-run orphanages, schools, and homes. For years, foreigners needed no
						background checks to open such institutions — meaning few knew Dow had been a registered sex
						offender in the U.S. until 2006.
						At least 83 children aged 9 months to 18 years lived in Dow’s home.
						After the two girls escaped in 2017, their parents filed complaints and Kenyan authorities
						arrested Dow’s wife, Mary Rose, on child-abuse charges. She later paid a small fine and was
						released, insisting the girls were “promiscuous” and that she took them for birth-control
						implants for their own “protection.”
						Investigators later confirmed Dow used these implants to avoid impregnating his victims.
						Dow fled Kenya and continued denying any wrongdoing on social media. He claimed locals were
						“jealous,” “rebellious,” and plotting to seize his property.
						Ruto spent months trying to get U.S. authorities to listen. She knocked on Dow’s door in
						Pennsylvania, contacted his associates on Facebook, and pushed through endless referrals between
						offices — police, the district attorney, the State Department, and the U.S. Embassy.
						> “For the longest time, I wondered: Will someone hear me? Will someone believe me?”
						Eventually, after a local newspaper in Lancaster published her findings, the FBI called. Months
						later, Dow was arrested.
						Broken Trust and Pain That Remains
						Villagers express deep regret and anger:
						> “I allowed my daughter to take her children to the White man because of poverty,”
						said Lucia Langat, baby James’s grandmother.
						“No one here will ever give their children to a White man again.”
						After the orphanage closed, children were sent to other homes or returned to families who had
						placed them there in desperation.
						Kenya has since banned foreigners from opening orphanages and introduced stricter background
						checks for missionary visas. Locals welcomed the changes, though many believe Dow deserved a
						life sentence and that families should receive compensation.
						Ruto still thinks of the victims whose cases were never proven in court.
						> “It was not just four girls,” she said. “The rest of the victims deserve so much better.
						Justice is not complete.”
						Haunted but determined, she has since enrolled in an online criminal-justice program, studying
						between grueling nursing shifts during the COVID-19 pandemic.

					<p>Chepkowa Tea Buying Centre Kericho County
						The first photo shows the abandoned project, which had become overgrown and bushy. Community
						members requested our CBO to follow up on the stalled project. We immediately sent our Advocacy
						Team and even facilitated a sports dialogue in Ainamoi to push for accountability.
						Months later, the contractor resumed work on the project. As seen in the second photo, the
						project is not yet complete, but there is clear progress — a sign of success.
						This project was funded in the 2019/2020 Financial Year by the County Government of Kericho,

					<h2 class="heading mb-4">Children’s Day event held in Makimeny, Chepalungu Constituency.</h2>
					<p>Voices for Justice CBO received an invitation from the Office of the Chief Magistrate, Bomet
						County, to participate in the Children’s Day event held in Makimeny, Chepalungu Constituency.
						During this period, our members made a second visit to a young girl who was defiled in 2023. The
						girl, Chebet, was born with a condition that has made her unable to walk or stand since birth.
						Despite her vulnerability, her case file against the alleged assailant was reportedly
						misplaced—an indication of delayed justice and possible denial of her rights.
						On 15/10/2025, our CBO team visited Chebet; a week later, together with our partners in Bomet,
						we submitted a petition demanding action.
						We are encouraged that the ODPP has now directed the OCS to arrest the assailant. We remain
						hopeful that justice will finally take its course.
						The girl has also expressed her wish to attend school, and we hope stakeholders will support her
						in accessing education.

					<p>Our Organisation is celebrating two life imprisonment convictions victories made possible through
						committed follow-up and strong community support.

						In Bureti Constituency, Chemosot Ward, Justice Kipsigie defiled a one-year-old child in April.
						Our Anti-GBV members led by Margaret Ruto visited the child in hospital and followed up the
						case. In September, Kericho Law Courts sentenced him to life imprisonment. A big win.

						In a similar case followed up by our Organisation in Kipkelion West, Lisirwa, David Kemei
						assaulted his wife twice. Our members rushed to Siloam Hospital and offered support. On Thursday
						20/11/2025, Kericho Law Courts sentenced him to life imprisonment. Another big win.

						Together we can end GBV.

					<h2 class="heading mb-4">History</h2>
					<p>Voices for justice-CBO (Voices for justice-CBO) is a Community Based Organisation (CBO) that
						 was established in 2015 by women and youths in Mutare and Mutasa Rural District after realising
						  that most women and youths are being left out in the economic development agenda. Women and Youth
						   exclusion was noted as being most pronounced in the mining sector which is an important pillar to
						    the economic development of Kenya. During its conception, the organisation noted that Women and youths
							 have limited opportunities for employment in the mining sector. If opportunities are extended in the
							  mining sector for these marginalised groups, there will be realisation of Sustainable development Goal
							   5, which is important in the Government’s achievement of its overall vision on equity and equality.<a href="about.html"> click here for more...</a>
